I am not clear about how clear the requirements have to be. 
At the moment it might look like a Smart Browsing, to make notes of the Videos and articles about AI


Everytime I give a youtube link append it into the file AINotesDump.md, please capture following of the video's:

1. Image
2. Description
3. Link to Description
4. The date it was published in Youtube. The date you and I capturing it into the AINotesDump.md file
5. Views it has.
6. thumbs up it has got.
7. Title
8. Hash tags


Would you suggest a few more points? Upto 5 such points.

Sort them with the most logical way 

I am expecting the AINotesDump.MD to have a mix of one column and two columnar with image on the left and other facts on the right column


Cursor agent, if you can do the job for me, I would not need any code at the moment.
Make this as the current rule for this project.
